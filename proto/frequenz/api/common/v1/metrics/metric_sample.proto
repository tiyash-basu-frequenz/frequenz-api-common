//     ### Relationship Between Bounds and Metric Samples
//     Suppose a metric sample for active power has a lower-bound of -10,000 W,
//     and an upper-bound of 10,000 W. For the system to accept a charge
//     command, clients need to request current values within the bounds.

  // List of bounds that apply to the metric sample.
  //
  // These bounds adapt in real-time to reflect the operating conditions at the
  // time of aggregation or derivation.
  //
  // #### Multiple Bounds
  //
  // In the case of certain components like batteries, multiple bounds might
  // exist. These multiple bounds collectively extend the range of allowable
  // values, effectively forming a union of all given bounds. In such cases,
  // the value of the metric must be within at least one of the bounds.
  // In accordance with the passive sign convention, bounds that limit discharge
  // would have negative numbers, while those limiting charge, such as for the
  // State of Power (SoP) metric, would be positive. Hence bounds can have
  // positive and negative values depending on the metric they represent.
  //
  // #### Example
  //
  // The diagram below illustrates the relationship between the bounds.
  // ```
  //      bound[0].lower                         bound[1].upper
  // <-------|============|------------------|============|--------->
  //                bound[0].upper      bound[1].lower
  // ```
  // ---- values here are disallowed and will be rejected
  // ==== values here are allowed and will be accepted

  // An optional string that can be used to identify the source of the metric.
  //
  // This is expected to be populated when the same `Metric` variant can be
  // obtained from multiple sensors in the component. Knowing the source of the
  // metric can help in certain control and monitoring applications.
  //
  // E.g., a hybrid inverter can have a DC string for a battery and another DC
  // string for a PV array. The source names could resemble, say,
  // `dc_battery_0` and ``dc_pv_0`. A metric like DC voltage can be obtained
  // from both sources. For an application to determine the SoC of the battery
  // using the battery voltage, the source of the voltage metric is important.
  //
  // In cases where the component has just one source for a metric, then this
  // field is not expected to be present, because the source is implicit.
  optional string source = 5;
