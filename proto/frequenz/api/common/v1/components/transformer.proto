package frequenz.api.common.v1.components.transformer;

// A representation of a voltage transformer.
// Voltage transformers are used to step up or step down the voltage, keeping
// the power somewhat constant by increasing or decreasing the current.
// If voltage is stepped up, current is stepped down, and vice versa.
// Note that voltage transformers have efficiency losses, so the output power
// is always less than the input power.
message VoltageTransformer {
  // The primary voltage of the transformer.
  // This is the input voltage that is stepped up or down.
  float primary = 1;

  // The secondary voltage of the transformer.
  // This is the output voltage that is the result of stepping the primary
  // voltage up or down.
  float secondary = 2;
