// Microgrid contains details of a specific microgrid. A microgrid is a

// feature is that it has a physical location and is situated in a delivery
// area.
//
// !!! info "Key Concepts"
//      - `Physical Location`: Geographical coordinates specify the exact
//        physical location of the microgrid.
//      - `Delivery Area`: Each microgrid is part of a broader delivery area,
//        which is crucial for energy trading and compliance.
